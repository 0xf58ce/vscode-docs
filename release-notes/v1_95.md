## GitHub Copilot

### A new place for Chat: Secondary side bar

The new default location for the Chat view is the [secondary sidebar](https://aka.ms/vscode-secondary-sidebar) for a more integrated AI experience in VS Code. You can quickly get to chat using the `kb(workbench.action.chat.open)` keyboard shortcut.

![Chat view in its new location after having moved](<images/1_95/chat-new-location.png>)

With the introduction of the new Chat menu next to command center, bringing up the secondary sidebar with chat is just a click away:

<video src="images/1_95/chat-video.mp4" title="Chat in secondary sidebar." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

The chat menu provides entries to the most common tasks with Copilot Chat. If you wish to hide this menu, a new setting `setting(chat.commandCenter.enabled)` is provided.

![Chat Menu](<images/1_95/chat-menu.png>)

**Note:** If you previously had installed GitHub Copilot, a view will show up at the location you had Chat before allowing you to restore the old location if that works better for you.

![Chat view in its old location after having moved](<images/1_95/chat-old-location.png>)

### Sort by relevance in Semantic Search (Experimental)

**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.search.semanticTextResults)`

Last milestone, we introduced the ability to perform a semantic search using Copilot to get search results that are semantically relevant to your query. We have now improved the search results by sorting them by their relevance. Keyword matches from more relevant snippets are deemed more relevant overall.

### Control current editor context

Copilot Chat has always automatically included your current selection or the currently visible code as context with your chat request. Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally good at understanding whether a piece of context is relevant. But sometimes, when you ask a question that is not about your current editor, including this context might affect how the model interprets your question.

We now show a special attachment control in the chat input that gives a hint about the editor context and which enables you to toggle whether or not to include the editor context.

![The current editor context control in the chat input, which shows that the context is not included.](<images/1_95/Screenshot 2024-10-25 at 3.23.55 PM.png>)

There are no changes to the behavior of the editor context. When the active editor has a selection, then just the selection is included. Otherwise, just the code that is scrolled into view is included. You can still attach other files or the full file by using the paperclip button or by typing `#` in the chat prompt.

### Symbol links in responses

### Chat settings updates

As we continue to add new features to GitHub Copilot, we want to make it easier to check out what's new and ready to try out. We've restructured our settings and added support [for tagging preview and experiment settings](#settings-editor-indicator-for-experimental-and-preview-settings). New features may go through these early access stages which are described in the settings editor as follows:

**Experimental** This setting controls a new feature that is actively being developed and may be unstable. It is subject to change or removal.

**Preview** This setting controls a new feature that is still under refinement yet ready to use. Feedback is welcome.

You can check out all of GitHub Copilot's [preview features](command:workbench.action.openSettings?%5B%22%40tag%3Apreview%20%40ext%3Agithub.copilot-chat%22%5D) using `@tag:preview` in the Settings editor and all of the [experimental features](command:workbench.action.openSettings?%5B%22%40tag%3Aexperimental%20%40ext%3Agithub.copilot-chat%22%5D) using `@tag:experimental`.


## Accessibility


## Workbench

### Multiple GitHub accounts

Graduating last month's feature to the default behavior, it's now possible to be logged in to multiple GitHub accounts in VS Code at the same time.

![Multiple GitHub Accounts in the Account Menu](images/1_95/multi-github-accounts.png)

Here are a couple of scenarios in which you might need multiple accounts:

* Use *Account1* for Settings Sync and *Account2* for the GitHub Pull Request extension
* Use *Account1* for the GitHub extension (to push) and *Account2* for GitHub Copilot

To use this functionality, simply trigger a log in action (either with a built-in feature like Settings Sync or with an extension), and you'll be given the option to log in to a different account. This feature also pairs nicely with the [Account Preference Quick Pick](#add-additional-accounts-when-changing-account-preferences), should you need to change the selected account at a later stage.

While most things should just continue to work with your existing extensions, some behaviors might not play perfectly nice with this multi-account world just yet. If you think there's room for improvement, do open an issue on those extensions. With the help of the relatively new `vscode.authentication.getAccounts('github')` API, extensions have a lot of power to handle multiple accounts.

### Settings editor indicator for Experimental and Preview settings

To highlight experimental or upcoming features, the Settings editor now displays indicators next to experimental and preview settings.
Extension authors can add "experimental" or "preview" tags to their settings to show the corresponding indicator in the Settings editor.

![Settings editor showing Occurrences Highlight Delay setting with Preview indicator next to it](images/1_95/occurrences-preview-setting.png)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/mgwg.light-pink-theme))_


### Add additional accounts when changing account preferences

Last month, we introduced the [Account Preference Quick Pick](./v1_94.md#change-an-extensions-account-preference), which is useful for changing the preferred account to use for an extension should you need to change that for any reason.

One of the pieces of feedback we received was around wanting an easy way to add an account that is not yet logged in. This milestone, we have introduced a new item in the Quick Pick that enables you to do just that. Use the **Use a new account...** item to start an authentication flow and set the account preference to that account in one go.

![Use a new account option in the account preference quick pick](images/1_95/use-new-account.png)

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_95.md).

## VS Code for the Web

### Local file events support

When using Chrome or Edge as of version 129, opening <https://vscode.dev> with a local folder now supports file events. If you make changes to files and folders of the opened workspace outside the browser, these changes will be reflected immediately inside the browser.

This feature is leveraging the new [`FileSystemObserver`](https://chromestatus.com/feature/4622243656630272) interface that is proposed as new API for the web.

## Contributions to extensions

### Copilot-powered extensions

This milestone, the team worked on building several extensions that showcase how you can extend Copilot in VS Code extensions.

### Web Search for Copilot

This extension showcases:

* Chat Participant & Tool APIs
* [prompt-tsx](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-prompt-tsx)
* How to leverage the language models provided by GitHub Copilot

The source code is [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-websearchforcopilot).

#### Description

Get the most up-to-date and relevant information from the web right in Copilot.

This is powered by one of two different search engines, configured by `setting(websearch.preferredEngine)`:

* [Tavily](http://tavily.com) (default)
* [Bing](https://bing.com)

As a user, you'll need to acquire an API key from one of these services to use this extension. Upon first use, it asks you for that key and stores it using VS Code's built-in secret storage, and can be managed via VS Code's authentication stack as well just as you would for your GitHub account.

#### Chat Participant

This extension contributes the
`@websearch`
chat participant, which is capable of handling questions that likely need live information from the internet.
You can invoke it manually using
`@websearch when did Workspace Trust ship in vscode?`

![the question when did Workspace Trust ship in vscode and the answer showing the references and whatnot](images/1_95/websearch-participant.png)

#### Chat Tool

This extension contributes the
`#websearch`
chat tool as well, which is similar to the participant but is useful for providing context from the web in other chat participants.
For example:
* `@workspace /new #websearch create a new web app written in Python using the most popular framework`

![the question create a new web app written in Python using the most popular framework using the websearch variable with slash new. The result is a project using Django](images/1_95/websearch-tool.png)

Additionally,
if you are working on your own Chat Particpant or Tool,
you can consume this Chat Tool via the
`vscode.lm.invokeTool`
API.

### MermAId Diagram Generation with Copilot

The vscode-mermAId (id: ms-vscode.copilot-mermaid-diagram) extension contributes a new chat participat to GitHub Copilot to build and modify visualizations for your code with Mermaid, a markdown-inspired diagraming and charting tool.

#### Create and Render Diagrams

Create any type of Mermaid-support diagrams through chat conversations and use the iterate slash command to refine it. Slash commands are available for specific diagrams to provide extra guidance to the model.

<video src="images/1_95/iterate-on-sequence-diagram.mp4" title="Create a sequence diagram then iterate to remove a participant" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Links will be added for certain diagram types, like flow, to point back to the references that were gathered to build the diagram.

<video src="images/1_95/diagram-with-links-short.mp4" title="Generate a diagram then click a link back to a referenced piece of code" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Mermaid Outline View

Harness the mermaid outline view to generate class diagrams per file right in the explore panel.

#### Symbols Chat Tool

The extension contributes a tools to gather symbol information within files or the entire workspace and can be consumed by other chat participants when this extension is installed.

### Python

#### Native REPL Variables view

The Native Python REPL now provides up-to-date variables for the built-in Variables view. This lets you dig into the state of the interpreter as you execute code from files or through the REPL input box.

<video src="images/1_95/python-variable-view.mp4" title="Opening the variable view within the debug panel after executing code in the native REPL" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Generate docstrings with Pylance

You can now more conveniently generate documentation for your Python code with Pylance's docstrings template generation feature! You can generate a docstring template for classes or methods by typing `"""` or `'''`, pressing `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`, or selecting the lightbulb to invoke the **Generate Docstring** code action. The generated docstring includes fields for the function's description, parameters, parameter types, return and return types.

<video src="images/1_95/pylance-generate-docstring.mp4" title="Generating docstring templates for a function with Pylance by invoking Ctrl+Space inside a pair of triple quotes." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

This feature is currently behind an experimental setting, but we look forward to making it the default experience soon. You can try it out today by enabling the `setting(python.analysis.supportDocstringTemplate:true)` setting.

#### Fold all docstrings with Pylance

Documentation strings are great for providing context and explanations for your code, but sometimes you might want to fold them to focus on the code itself. You can now more easily do so by folding docstrings with the new **Pylance: Fold All Docstrings** command, which can also be bound to a keybinding of your choice. To unfold them, use the **Pylance: Unfold All Docstrings** command.

<video src="images/1_95/pylance-fold-docstrings.mp4" title="Folding and unfolding docstrings with Pylance's new commands." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Improve import suggestions with Pylance

One of Pylance's powerful features is its ability to provide auto-import suggestions. By default, Pylance offers the import suggestion from where the symbol is defined, but you might want it to import it from a file where the symbol is imported (i.e. aliased).  With the new `setting(python.analysis.includeAliasesFromUserFiles:true)` setting, you can now control whether Pylance includes alias symbols from user files in its auto-import suggestions or in the add import Quick Fix.

Note that enabling this setting can negatively impact performance, especially in large codebases, as Pylance may need to index more symbols and monitor more files for changes, which can increase resource usage.

## Extension Authoring

### Tools for language models

We have finalized our [`LanguageModelTool` API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#lm.tools)! This API enables chat extensions to build more powerful experiences by connecting language models to external data sources, or take actions. The API comes with two major parts:

1. The ability for extensions to register a *tool*. A tool is a piece of functionality that is meant to be used by language models. For example, reading the Git history of a file. When a tool is registered using the `lm.registerTool` method, it's accessible to other extensions as well, in the `lm.tools` list. This will enable chat extensions to seamlessly integrate with other extensions via an ecosystem of shared tools.

2. The mechanics for language models to support tools, such as extensions passing tools when making a request, language models requesting a tool invocation, and extensions communicating back the result of a tool invocation.

The use of language model tools is complex, and this API does not hide that complexity. If you want to register a tool or make use of tools in your chat participant, we recommend starting with the API docs and the extension sample (TODO links).

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

### VS Code Speech

The [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension is updated to the August version of the [Azure Speech SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/releasenotes?tabs=speech-sdk#speech-sdk-140-2024-august-release) and comes with newer models for speech-to-text recognition. You should see improved results with this update for the [speech-to-text integrations in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/voice), such as Copilot Chat.

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 5.7

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Proposed APIs


## Engineering

### Prompt building library for LLMs

This month, we've open sourced our [@vscode/prompt-tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/prompt-tsx) library, which we've developed and used in Copilot Chat over the past year for crafting language model prompts. The library enables developers to create their prompts using TSX/JSX syntax, similar to React, and includes a variety of tools to make the best use of prompts' token budget.

### AMD code removal and more ESM use in web

We removed the last traces of AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) from our sources, mainly from the build scripts that we still kept for supporting AMD in case needed for a recovery release.

In addition, <https://vscode.dev> is now also running 100% with ESM (ECMAScript Modules) only.

### Migration to ESLint 9

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Notable fixes

* [177046](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/177046) will crash after searching at extension panel

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
