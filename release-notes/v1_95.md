## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_95.md).

## VS Code for the Web

### Local file events support

When using Chrome or Edge from version 129, opening https://vscode.dev with a local folder now supports file events. If you make changes to files and folders of the opened workspace outside the browser, these will be reflected immediately.

This feature is leveraging the new [`FileSystemObserver`](https://chromestatus.com/feature/4622243656630272) interface that is proposed as new API for the web.

## Contributions to extensions

### Copilot-powered extensions

This milestone, the team has been working on building several extensions that showcase how you can extend Copilot in VS Code extensions.


### Python


### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

### VS Code Speech

The [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension is updated to the August version of the [Azure Speech SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/releasenotes?tabs=speech-sdk#speech-sdk-140-2024-august-release) and comes with newer models for speech-to-text recognition. You should see improved results with this update for the speech-to-text integrations in VS Code such as Copilot Chat.

## Preview Features


## Proposed APIs


## Engineering

### AMD code removal and more ESM use in web

We removed the last traces of AMD from our sources, mainly from the build scripts that we still kept for supporting AMD in case needed for a recovery release.

In addition, https://vscode.dev is now also running 100% with ESM only.

## Notable fixes

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
