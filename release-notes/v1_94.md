## GitHub Copilot


## Accessibility

### Getting Started
Our `Help` menu now includes a `Get Started with Accessibility Features` walkthrough, making it easier for users to explore and utilize accessibility options.

### Comment Accessibility Improvements
We have introduced an accessible view for comment thread widgets. This view includes the relevant editor context, allowing users to stay focused without needing to switch between the editor and the accessible view. Likewise, the editor context is now provided in the accessible view for the comments panel.

We've introduced the command `Comments: Focus Comment on Current Line`, enabling users to quickly move to the comment widget from the editor using the keyboard.
