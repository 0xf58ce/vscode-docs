## GitHub Copilot

### Inline chat and completions within native REPL

The native REPL editor used by the python extension now supports co-pilot inline chat and ghost text directly in the input box.

### Improved file links in chat responses

<!-- TODO: mjbvz: icons, hover, dnd, context menu -->

### Start debugging from Chat (Experimental)

**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.experimental.startDebugging.enabled)`

The experimental slash command `/startDebugging` has been improved in this iteration and is now available by default on the `@vscode` chat participant. This command enables you to easily find or create a launch configuration and start debugging your application seamlessly.

## Accessibility

### Getting Started
Our `Help` menu now includes a `Get Started with Accessibility Features` walkthrough, making it easier for users to explore and utilize accessibility options.

### Comment Accessibility Improvements
We have introduced an accessible view for comment thread widgets. This view includes the relevant editor context, allowing users to stay focused without needing to switch between the editor and the accessible view. Likewise, the editor context is now provided in the accessible view for the comments panel.

We've introduced the command `Comments: Focus Comment on Current Line`, enabling users to quickly move to the comment widget from the editor using the keyboard.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_94.md).


## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Run tests with coverage
You can now run Python tests with coverage in VS Code! To run tests with coverage, select the coverage run icon in the Test Explorer or “Run with coverage” from any menu you normally trigger test runs from. The Python extension will run coverage using the [`pytest-cov`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) plugin if you are using pytest, or with [`coverage.py`](http://coverage.py/) for unittest.

Once the coverage run is complete, lines will be highlighted in the editor for line level coverage. These can be closed and re-opened via the Run Results panel in the bottom where it says "Close Test Coverage" or "View Test Coverage" under the most recent test run. Additionally, a Test Coverage tab will appear below the Testing tab in the Test Explorer, also with a beaker icon, which you can also navigate to with **Testing: Focus on Test Coverage View** in Command Palette (`F1)`). On this panel you can view line and branch coverage metrics for each file and folder in your workspace.

For more information on running Python tests with coverage, see our [Python test coverage documentation](). For general information on test coverage, see VS Code's [Test Coverage documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/testing#_test-coverage).

#### Python default Problem Matcher 
The Python extension now includes a default problem matcher, simplifying issue tracking in your Python code and offering more contextual feedback. To integrate it, add `"problemMatcher": "$python"` to your tasks in `task.json`. A problem matcher scans the task's output for errors and warnings and displays them in the Problems panel, enhancing your development workflow.

Below is an example of a `task.json` file that uses the default problem matcher for Python:
```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Run Python",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "${command:python.interpreterPath}",
            "args": [
                "${file}"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": "$python"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Engineering

### ESM is shipping for VS Code

We are finally shipping our ESM work in VS Code stable releases. That means, all layers of VS Code core (electron, node.js, browser, workers) use the `import` and `export` syntax in JavaScript for module loading and exporting. All usages of our legacy AMD loader are disabled and will be removed as part of our debt week in October.

The move to ESM massively improves startup performance. For one, a lot of AMD overhead is removed, but then the main workbench bundle size is also reduced by more than 10%:

![Main bundle load time](images/1_94/esm.png)

Now that we are fully converted to ESM, we plan to improve our engineering system for VS Code. With ESM, a lot of modern tooling will work for us and we are very excited to share more details about this in the near future.

**Note:** extensions are not impacted by this change and not loaded via ESM, please see https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/130367


## Notable fixes
