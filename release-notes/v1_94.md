## GitHub Copilot

### Inline chat and completions within native REPL

The native REPL editor used by the python extension now supports co-pilot inline chat and ghost text directly in the input box.

### Improved file links in chat responses

<!-- TODO: mjbvz: icons, hover, dnd, context menu -->

### Start debugging from Chat (Experimental)

**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.experimental.startDebugging.enabled)`

The experimental slash command `/startDebugging` has been improved in this iteration and is now available by default on the `@vscode` chat participant. This command enables you to easily find or create a launch configuration and start debugging your application seamlessly.

### Refreshed welcome view and chat input

We've refreshed the chat panel with a clean new welcome view, and we've updated the layout of the chat input. We've added a `@` button to make it easier to find chat participants that are built-in or from chat extensions that you've installed. You can also still find these by typing `/` or `@` as you could before.

### File attachments included in history

There are multiple ways to attach a file or selection to your request as context, for example, the üìé button, or `#`. Previously these were included for the current request, but not in the history of subsequent requests. Now, these attachments are kept in history so that you can keep asking about them.

![persistent file attachments](<images/1_94/file-attachment.png>)

## Accessibility

### Getting Started
Our `Help` menu now includes a `Get Started with Accessibility Features` walkthrough, making it easier for users to explore and utilize accessibility options.

### Comment Accessibility Improvements
We have introduced an accessible view for comment thread widgets. This view includes the relevant editor context, allowing users to stay focused without needing to switch between the editor and the accessible view. Likewise, the editor context is now provided in the accessible view for the comments panel.

We've introduced the command `Comments: Focus Comment on Current Line`, enabling users to quickly move to the comment widget from the editor using the keyboard.

## Workbench

### Ability to change an extension's account preference

Last iteration, we explored how we would improve the experience of changing the account preference for an extension. Say you accidentally signed in to GitHub Copilot using the wrong account and want to use a different one.

It's now possible to change that preference after the fact in a few places.

* Account menu (the person icon) -> Your Account -> Manage Trusted Extensions -> The gear button on each item in the list:
  ![manage trusted extensions quick pick, with gear button highlighted](images/1_94/accountPreferenceManageTrustedExtensions.png)
* Extensions view -> context menu (or gear icon) on an extension that uses auth -> "Account Preferences" option
  ![account preferences option in the context menu of an extension](images/1_94/accountPreferenceContextMenu.png)
* An extension view -> gear icon -> "Account Preferences" option
  ![account preferences option in the gear menu of an extension](images/1_94/accountPreferenceGear.png)

Choosing any of these options will take you here allowing you to change the account that an extension uses:

![the account preference quick pick](images/1_94/accountPreferenceQuickPick.png)

This preference change does send an event to the extension and it is up to the extension to handle it properly, so if you don't see the expected behavior, do get an issue going with that extension so the experience can be ironed out.

Also, let us know if you have any feedback on this flow.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_94.md).


## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Run tests with coverage
You can now run Python tests with coverage in VS Code! To run tests with coverage, select the coverage run icon in the Test Explorer or ‚ÄúRun with coverage‚Äù from any menu you normally trigger test runs from. The Python extension will run coverage using the [`pytest-cov`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) plugin if you are using pytest, or with [`coverage.py`](http://coverage.py/) for unittest.

Once the coverage run is complete, lines will be highlighted in the editor for line level coverage. These can be closed and re-opened via the Run Results panel in the bottom where it says "Close Test Coverage" or "View Test Coverage" under the most recent test run. Additionally, a Test Coverage tab will appear below the Testing tab in the Test Explorer, also with a beaker icon, which you can also navigate to with **Testing: Focus on Test Coverage View** in Command Palette (`F1)`). On this panel you can view line and branch coverage metrics for each file and folder in your workspace.

For more information on running Python tests with coverage, see our [Python test coverage documentation](). For general information on test coverage, see VS Code's [Test Coverage documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/testing#_test-coverage).

#### Python default Problem Matcher
The Python extension now includes a default problem matcher, simplifying issue tracking in your Python code and offering more contextual feedback. To integrate it, add `"problemMatcher": "$python"` to your tasks in `task.json`. A problem matcher scans the task's output for errors and warnings and displays them in the Problems panel, enhancing your development workflow.

Below is an example of a `task.json` file that uses the default problem matcher for Python:
```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Run Python",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "${command:python.interpreterPath}",
            "args": [
                "${file}"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": "$python"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Pylance Language Server Mode

There's a new setting <a href="vscode://settings/python.analysis.languageServerMode" codesetting="true">`python.analysis.languageServerMode`</a> that allows you to choose between our current IntelliSense experience or a  lightweight one, optimized for performance. If you don't require the full breadth of IntelliSense capabilities and prefer Pylance to be as resource-friendly as possible, you can set <a href="vscode://settings/python.analysis.languageServerMode" codesetting="true">`python.analysis.languageServerMode`</a> to `light`. Otherwise, to continue with the experience you have with Pylance today, you can set it to `default`.

This new functionality overrides the default values of the following settings:


| Setting                           | `light` mode   | `default` mode   |
| :----------------------------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| "python.analysis.exclude"                 | ["**"]      | []         |
| "python.analysis.useLibraryCodeForTypes"    | false       | true       |
| "python.analysis.enablePytestSupport"       | false       | true       |
| "python.analysis.indexing"                 | false       | true       |

The  settings above can still be changed individually to override the default values.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues


## Preview Features

### Experimental Multiple GitHub Accounts

Being logged in to multiple GitHub Accounts in VS Code at the same time is now possible.

This is on by default in VS Code Insiders and in stable builds of VS Code, you can turn this on with the <a href="vscode://settings/github.experimental.multipleAccounts" codesetting="true">`github.experimental.multipleAccounts`</a>.

Here are a couple of scenarios:
* Use Account1 for Settings Sync and Account2 for the GitHub Pull Request extension
* Use Account1 for the GitHub extension (to push) and Account2 for GitHub Copilot

In order to leverage this, simply trigger a log in (either with a built-in feature like Settings Sync or with an Extension) and you'll be given the option to log in to a different account. This feature also pairs nicely with the new [Account Preference quick pick](#ability-to-change-an-extensions-account-preference) should you need to change the account after the fact.

While most things should just work with your existing extensions, some behaviors might not play perfectly nice with this multi-account world just yet. If you think there's room for improvement, do open an issue on those extensions. With the help of the relatively new `vscode.authentication.getAccounts('github')` API, extensions have a lot of power to handle multiple accounts.

Next iteration we are planning on turning this on by default for all users.

### MSAL-based Microsoft Authentication

We have been moving towards having our Microsoft Authentication stack use [MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library)](http://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js). It's been a huge undertaking, but we have made great progress this iteration. This work spans all VS Code clients so that includes VS Code & vscode.dev.

* For vscode.dev, we have enabled the browser-based MSAL.js for all Microsoft auth requests. In other words, vscode.dev is entirely on MSAL.
* For VS Code, the desktop client, we have this feature behind a setting, <a href="vscode://settings/microsoft.useMsal" codesetting="true">`microsoft.useMsal`</a>. It's behind a setting for now, as we plan on moving towards [the broker flow](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/brokering.md) which would allow VS Code to use the authentication state of the operating system. So to prevent as little interuption as possible, we will do that work first before enabling this widely. That said, if you're eager to try this new auth, you are welcome to try and provide us feedback.

You can see the detailed status of this transition to MSAL across all of VS Code in [Issue #178740](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/178740).

### TypeScript 5.7

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->


## Proposed APIs

### Tools for language models

We continue to iterate on our `LanguageModelTool` API. The API comes with two major parts:

1. The ability for extensions to register a *tool*. A tool is a piece of functionality that is meant to be used by language models. For example, reading the Git history of a file.

2. The mechanics for language models to support tools, such as extensions passing tools when making a request, language models requesting a tool invocation, and extensions communicating back the result of a tool invocation.

One of the changes this month adds the ability for tools to request user confirmation before running. This is helpful for tools that may have some side-effect.

Take a look at [issue #213274](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/213274) for more details or to give us feedback.

> **Note**: The API is still under active development, and things will change.


## Engineering

### ESM is shipping for VS Code

We are finally shipping our ESM work in VS Code stable releases. That means, all layers of VS Code core (electron, node.js, browser, workers) use the `import` and `export` syntax in JavaScript for module loading and exporting. All usages of our legacy AMD loader are disabled and will be removed as part of our debt week in October.

The move to ESM massively improves startup performance. For one, a lot of AMD overhead is removed, but then the main workbench bundle size is also reduced by more than 10%:

![Main bundle load time](images/1_94/esm.png)

Now that we are fully converted to ESM, we plan to improve our engineering system for VS Code. With ESM, a lot of modern tooling will work for us and we are very excited to share more details about this in the near future.

**Note:** extensions are not impacted by this change and not loaded via ESM, please see https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/130367


## Notable fixes
