## GitHub Copilot

### Copilot Edits

Copilot Edits has gotten better at showing what it does. When editing files, it now shows how far it already is and when done you have an editor control to cycle through all changes and accept or discard them.

<video src="images/1_96/chat-edits.mp4" title="Copilot Edits changing a file" autoplay loop controls muted></video>


#### Move session from panel chat

A conversation that has started in Chat can now be moved to Copilot Edits. This allows to apply code suggestions from a chat session via edits.

![Edit with Copilot showing for a chat exchange](images/1_96/chat-move.png)

#### Suggested files for working set

In a Git repo, when you have added one or more files to your working set, Copilot Edits now suggests additional related files to edit. These suggestions also appear in `#` completions in the chat input box.

#### Easily add files to Copilot Edits from explorer, search, and editor

You can add files to your Copilot Edits working set with the new **Add File to Copilot Edits** context menu action on search results and files in the explorer view. Additionally, you can attach a selection to Copilot Edits from the editor context menu.

### Copilot usage chart

You can now see a chart of an extension's copilot usage in the Runtime Status view. This chart shows the number of chat requests made by the extension over the last 30 days.

![Copilot usage chart in the Runtime Status view](images/1_96/copilot-usage-chart.png)

### Commit message generation custom instructions

This milestone we have added support for custom instructions when generating a commit message. You can use the `setting(github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions)` setting to either specify cthe ustom instructions or specify a file from your workspace that contains the custom instructions. These instructions will be appended to the prompt that is used to generate the commit message.

### Inline Chat

We tweaked the inline chat UI, its progress reporting is more subtle, during streaming sqiggles are disabled, and detected commands are rendered more nicely.

Also, we have continued to improve our pseudo code detection and now show a hint to continue with Copilot when a line is dominated by natural language.

![Inline Chat Hint with a line that is dominated by natural language](images/1_96/inline-chat-nl-hint.png)

Trigger inline chat from this hint will remove the line, give it to Copilot as instruction, so that the desired output is created. Also, know that this flow also always be triggered via `kb(inlineChat.startWithCurrentLine)`.

Additionally, there is another setting to make an inline chat hint appear on empty lines. This can be enabled via `setting(inlineChat.lineEmptyHint)`



## Accessibility

### Code action triggered, applied sounds

Users can now hear when a code action has been triggered or applied with `setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionTriggered)` and
`setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionApplied)`.

## Workbench

### Improved extension search results

When searching for extensions using free-form text in the Extensions view, installed extensions now appear at the top of the search results. This makes it easier to find and manage your installed extensions when searching through the marketplace.

![Installed extensions shown at top of search results](images/1_96/extension-search-order.png)

### Download Extensions from the Extensions view

You can now download extensions directly from VS Code by using the download action in the context menu of an extension in the Extensions view. This can be useful if you want to download an extension without installing it.

![Download Extensions from the Extensions view](images/1_96/extensions-download.png)

### Extension Memory Usage on Disk

You can now see the memory usage of an extension on disk in the Extensions editor. This can help you understand how much disk space an extension is using.

![Extension Memory Usage on Disk in the Extensions view](images/1_96/extension-memory-usage-on-disk.png)

### Extension updates optimization with vscode-unpkg service

To reduce load on the Marketplace infrastructure, VS Code now uses the newly added endpoint from the `vscode-unpkg` service to check for extension updates. The service implements server-side caching with a 10-minute TTL, significantly reducing the number of direct Marketplace requests. The optimization is controlled via `setting(extensions.gallery.useUnpkgResourceApi)` setting (enabled by default). If you are seeing any issues with extension updates, you can disable this `setting(extensions.gallery.useUnpkgResourceApi:false)` to fall back to direct Marketplace version checks.

### Quickly move views between primary or secondary side bar

A new context menu on view containers makes it easy to move them between primary side bar, secondary side bar and panel:

<video src="images/1_96/move-views.mp4" title="Move view containers" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Allow to hide navigation controls in the title area

A new setting `setting(workbench.navigationControl.enabled)` allows to hide the back/forward buttons in the title area.

You can also access this setting from the right-click menu in the title area when selecting the "Navigation Controls" entry:

![Navigation Controls Menu](images/1_96/nav-controls.png)

## Editor

### Configure preferred edit type for copy+paste and drag+drop
When you drag and drop or copy and paste a file into a text editor, VS Code provides multiple ways to insert it into that file. By default VS Code will try to insert the file's workspace relative path, but you can use the use the drop/paste widget to switch how the resource is inserted. Extensions can also provide customized edits, such as in Markdown which [provides edits that insert Markdown links](v1_67.md#markdown-drop-into-editor-to-create-link).

With the new `setting(editor.pasteAs.preferences)` and `setting(editor.dropIntoEditor.preferences)` settings, you can now specify a preference for which edit type to use by default. For example, if you'd like copy/paste to always insert the absolute path of pasted files, just set:

```json
"editor.pasteAs.preferences": [
    "uri.path.absolute"
]
```

These settings are ordered lists of edit kinds. The first matching edit of a preferred kind will be applied by default. You can still use the drop/paste widget to change to a different type of edit after the default edit is applied.

These new settings play nicely with our [new copy and paste with imports support in JavaScript and TypeScript](#paste-with-imports-for-javascript-and-typescript). This feature automatically adds imports when copy and pasting code across JavaScript or TypeScript files. To avoid disrupting your workflows, by default we decided that paste will just insert plain text with `paste with imports` being offered as an option in the paste widget. However if you'd like VS Code to always try pasting with imports, just set:

```json
"editor.pasteAs.preferences": [
    "text.updateImports"
]
```

Now VS Code will automatically try to paste with imports when possible, falling back to pasting plain text if no paste with imports edit is available. Right now this only works for JavaScript and TypeScript but we hope additional languages will adopt support over time.

Finally, you can now also specify a preferred paste style when setting up a `editor.action.pasteAs` keybinding. The keybinding below will always try pasting and updating imports:

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+v",
    "command": "editor.action.pasteAs",
    "args": {
        "preferences": [
            "text.updateImports"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Source Control

## Git blame editor decoration/status bar item (Experimental)

This milestone we have added experimental support for displaying blame information using editor decorations and a status bar item. You can enable this functionality using the `setting(git.blame.editorDecoration.enabled:true)` and `setting(git.blame.statusBarItem.enabled:true)` settings. To control the format of the message shown in the editor and in the status bar use the `setting(git.blame.editorDecoration.template)` and `setting(git.blame.statusBarItem.template)` settings. If you would like to adjust the color of the editor decoration using the `git.blame.editorDecorationForeground` theme color.

Please give this experiemtal feature a try and let us know what you think.

### Source Control Graph title actions

Based on user feedback we have brought back the `Pull`, and `Push` actions to the "Source Control Graph" view title bar. These actions will be enabled if the current history item reference is being shown in the source control graph. Users that do not want to utilize these actions, or any other actions from the "Source Control Graph" view title bar, can right-click on them and choose the option to hide them.

## Terminal

### Terminal completions for zsh and bash (Experimental)

We added experimental support for terminal completions in `pwsh` in prior iterations.

Now, we offer completions in `zsh` and `bash` when `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled)` and
`setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enableExtensionCompletions)` are enabled.

Option and argument support is available for a small subset of commands: `cd`, `code`, and `code-insiders`.

![The command, code, is typed on the terminal, which shows suggestions. Then -- is typed and options are provided, --locale is selected. Completions are requested with ctrl+space and all locales are shown. e is typed and the list is filtered to en and es.](images/1_96/terminal-completions.gif)

## Tasks

## Languages

### TypeScript 5.7
Our JavaScript and TypeScript support now uses TypeScript 5.7. This major update includes a number of language and tooling improvements, along with important bug fixes and performance optimizations.

You can read all about the TypeScript 5.7 release [on the TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-7/). We've also included a few tooling highlights in the following sections.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

### The `@remote-ssh` Chat Participant

The Remote - SSH extension now includes a GitHub Copilot chat participant.  This participant has context on your recent SSH connections and can help you configure or troubleshoot elements of your remote environment. The participant will also answer more general SSH or remote development questions.

Enable the participant with `setting(remote.SSH.experimental.chat)`.

![diagnose-with-copilot-button](images/1_96/remote-ssh-participant-06.png)

<video src="images/1_96/remote-ssh-participant-08.mp4" title="Demo diagnosing last connection issue" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

<video src="images/1_96/remote-ssh-participant-01.mp4" title="Asking the Remote - SSH chat participant a question" autoplay loop controls muted></video>


### Enhanced Session Logging

Connection errors are sometimes complex to diagnose and fix.  For known classes of issues, the Remote - SSH extension will provide a summary of the detected issue and provide possible solutions.

Our troubleshooting database will continue to grow with each release and is used by GitHub Copilot to improve its problem solving skills.

Enable enhanced logging with `setting(remote.SSH.experimental.enhancedSessionLogs)`.

![enhanced-ssh-logging-table](images/1_96/remote-ssh-participant-02.png)

Combining enhanced logging with GitHub Copilot provides a powerful troubleshooting experience.

<!-- You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_96.md). -->

## Enterprise Support

### Configure Allowed Extensions

You can now control which extensions can be installed in VS Code using the `extensions.allowed` setting.  This setting allows you to specify allowed or blocked extensions by publisher, specific extensions and versions. If an extension or version is blocked, it will be disabled if already installed. You can specify the following types of extension selectors:

* Allow or block all extensions from a publisher
* Allow or block specific extensions
* Allow specific extension versions
* Allow specific extension versions and platforms
* Allow only stable versions of an extension
* Allow only stable extension versions from a publisher

The following JSON snippet shows examples of the different `extensions.allowed` setting values:

```json
"extensions.allowed": {
    // Allow all extensions from the 'microsoft' publisher. If the key does not have a '.', it means it is a publisher ID.
    "microsoft": true,

    // Allow all extensions from the 'github' publisher
    "github": true,

    // Allow prettier extension
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode": true,

    // Do not allow docker extension
    "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker": false,

    // Allow only version 3.0.0 of the eslint extension
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint": ["3.0.0"],

    // Allow multiple versions of the figma extension
    "figma.figma-vscode-extension": ["3.0.0", "4.2.3", "4.1.2"]

    // Allow version 5.0.0 of the rust extension on Windows and macOS
    "rust-lang.rust-analyzer": ["5.0.0@win32-x64", "5.0.0@darwin-x64"]

    // Allow only stable versions of the GitHub Pull Requests extension
    "github.vscode-pull-request-github": "stable",

    // Allow only stable versions from redhat publisher
    "redhat": "stable",
}
```

Specify publishers by their publisher ID. If a key does not have a period (`.`), it is considered a publisher ID. If a key has a period, it is considered an extension ID. The use of wildcards is currently not supported.

> [!TIP]
> You can use `microsoft` as the publisher ID to refer to all extensions published by Microsoft, even though they might have different publisher IDs.

Version ranges are not supported. If you want to allow multiple versions of an extension, you must specify each version individually. To further restrict versions by platform, use the `@` symbol to specify the platform. For example, `"rust-lang.rust-analyzer": ["5.0.0@win32-x64", "5.0.0@darwin-x64"]`.  For more details, refer to the [enterprise documentation](../docs/setup/enterprise.md#configure-allowed-extensions).

Administrators can also configure this setting via group policy on Windows. For more information, see the [Group Policy on Windows](../docs/setup/enterprise.md#group-policy-on-windows) section in the enterprise documentation.

## Set up VS Code with preinstalled extensions

You can set up VS Code with a set of preinstalled extensions (*bootstrap*). This functionality is useful in cases where you prepare a machine image, virtual machine, or cloud workstation where VS Code is preinstalled and specific extensions are immediately available for users.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for preinstalling extensions is currently only available on Windows.

Follow these steps to bootstrap extensions:

1. Create a folder `bootstrap\extensions` in the VS Code installation directory.

1. Download the [VSIX files](/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md#can-i-download-an-extension-directly-from-the-marketplace) for the extensions that you want to preinstall and place them in the `bootstrap\extensions` folder.

1. When a user launches VS Code for the first time, all extensions in the `bootstrap\extensions` folder are installed silently in the background.

Users can still uninstall extensions that were preinstalled. Restarting VS Code after uninstalling an extension will not reinstall the extension.

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Announcing the new Python Environments extension

In this release we are introducing the Python Environments extension, now available in preview on the Marketplace.

This extension simplifies Python environment management, offering a UI to create, delete, and manage environments, along with package management for installing and uninstalling packages.
Designed to integrate seamlessly with your preferred environment managers via various APIs, it supports Global Python interpreters, venv, and Conda by default. Developers can build extensions to add support for their favorite Python environment managers and integrate with our extension UI, enhancing functionality and user experience.

#### Python Testing Enhancements
* The `--rootdir` argument for pytest is now dynamically adjusted based on the presence of a `python.testing.cwd` setting in your workspace.
* Restarting a test debugging session now reruns only the specified tests.
* Coverage support updated to handle `NoSource` exceptions.
* `pytest-describe` plugin is supported with test detection and execution in the UI.
* The Testing Rewrite now leverages FIFO instead of UDS for interprocess communication allowing users to harness pytest plugins like `pytest_socket` in their own testing design.
* **Rewrite Nearing Default Status:** This release addresses [the final known issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/23279) in the testing rewrite, and unless further issues arrive, the rewrite experiment will be turned off and the rewrite set to default in early 2025.
#### Pylance "full" language server mode
The `python.analysis.languageServerMode` setting now also supports `full` mode, allowing you to take advantage of the complete range of Pylance's functionality and the most comprehensive IntelliSense experience. It's worth noting that this comes at the cost of lower performance, as it can cause Pylance to be resource-intensive, particularly in large codebases.

The `python.analysis.languageServerMode` setting now changes the default values of the following settings, depending on whether it's set to `light`, `default` or `full`:


| Setting                                             | light  | default | full |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|------|
| python.analysis.exclude                              | ["**"] | []      | []   |
| python.analysis.useLibraryCodeForTypes               | false  | true    | true |
| python.analysis.enablePytestSupport                  | false  | true    | true |
| python.analysis.indexing                             | false  | true    | true |
| python.analysis.autoImportCompletions                | false  | false   | true |
| python.analysis.showOnlyDirectDependenciesInAutoImport | false  | false   | true |
| python.analysis.packageIndexDepths                   | ```[ { "name": "sklearn", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "matplotlib", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "scipy", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "django", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "flask", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "fastapi", "depth": 2 } ]``` | ```[ { "name": "sklearn", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "matplotlib", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "scipy", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "django", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "flask", "depth": 2 }, { "name": "fastapi", "depth": 2 } ]``` | ```{ "name": "", "depth": 4,  "includeAllSymbols": true }``` |
| python.analysis.regenerateStdLibIndices              | false  | false   | true |
| python.analysis.userFileIndexingLimit                | 2000   | 2000    | -1   |
| python.analysis.includeAliasesFromUserFiles          | false  | false   | true |
| python.analysis.functionReturnTypes                  | false  | false   | true |

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

### Microsoft Account now uses MSAL (with WAM support on Windows)

In order to ensure a strong security baseline for Microsoft authentication, we've adopted the [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) in the Microsoft Account extension.

One of the stand out features of this work is WAM (Web Account Manager... also known as [Broker](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/brokering.md)) integration. Put simply, rather than going to the browser for Microsoft authentication flows, we now talk to the OS directly which is the recommended way of acquiring a Microsoft authentication session. Additionally, it's faster since we're able to leverage the accounts that you're already logged into on the OS.

![An authentication popup that the OS shows over VS Code](images/1_96/showingBrokerOSDialog.png)

Please let us know if you see any issues with this new flow. If you do see a major issue and need to revert back to the old Microsoft authentication behavior, you can do so with `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` (setting it to `classic`, and restarting VS Code) but do keep in mind that this setting won't be around for much longer... so open an issue
if you are having trouble with the MSAL flow.

## Preview Features


## Proposed APIs

### Proposed Value Selection API on Quick Pick

For `InputBox` you have been able to set the "value selection" which allows you to programmatically select part or all of the input. This iteration we added proposed API to allow value selection in a QuickPick.

Here's an example of what that might look like:

```ts
const qp = vscode.window.createQuickPick();
qp.value = '12345678';
qp.valueSelection = [4, 6];
qp.items = [
	{ label: '12345678', description: 'desc 1' },
	{ label: '12345678', description: 'desc 2' },
	{ label: '12345678', description: 'desc 3' },
];
qp.show();
```

![a couple characters are selected in the quick pick's input box](images/1_96/valueSelectionQuickPick.png)

Please try out the [valueSelectionInQuickPick proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/008340a55c6391f9b333010951455ee71b338787/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.valueSelectionInQuickPick.d.ts) and let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233274)!

### Proposed Native Window Handle API

This iteration we added a new proposed API that allows you to retrieve the native window handle of the focused window. The native window handle is an OS concept that essentially provides a pointer to a particular window. This is useful if you are interacting with native code and need to, for example, render a native dialog on top of a window.

```ts
declare module 'vscode' {

	export namespace window {
		/**
		 * Retrieves the native window handle of the current active window.
		 * This will be updated when the active window changes.
		 */
		export const nativeHandle: Uint8Array | undefined;
	}
}
```

This was added specifically for Microsoft Authentication's [adoption of MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/brokering.md#window-parenting) so that we could pass the native handle down to the OS so it could render an auth dialog overtop VS Code.

If you have a use-case or feedback for the [nativeWindowHandle proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/008340a55c6391f9b333010951455ee71b338787/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.nativeWindowHandle.d.ts), let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233106)!
