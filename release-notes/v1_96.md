## GitHub Copilot


## Accessibility

### Code action triggered, applied sounds

Users can now hear when a code action has been triggered or applied with `setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionTriggered)` and
`setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionApplied)`.

## Workbench


## Editor


## Source Control


## Terminal

### Terminal completions for zsh and bash (Experimental)

We added experimental support for terminal completions in `pwsh` in prior iterations.

Now, we offer completions in `zsh` and `bash` when `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled)` and
`setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enableExtensionCompletions)` are enabled.

Option and argument support is available for a small subset of commands: `cd`, `code`, and `code-insiders`.

![The command, code, is typed on the terminal, which shows suggestions. Then -- is typed and options are provided, --locale is selected. Completions are requested with ctrl+space and all locales are shown. e is typed and the list is filtered to en and es.](images/1_96/terminal-completions.gif)

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_96.md).

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

### Microsoft Account now uses MSAL (with WAM support on Windows)

In order to ensure a strong security baseline for Microsoft authentication, we've adopted the [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) in the Microsoft Account extension.

One of the stand out features of this work is WAM (Web Account Manager... also known as [Broker](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/brokering.md)) integration. Put simply, rather than going to the browser for Microsoft authentication flows, we now talk to the OS directly which is the recommended way of acquiring a Microsoft authentication session. Additionally, it's faster since we're able to leverage the accounts that you're already logged into on the OS.

![An authentication popup that the OS shows over VS Code](images/1_96/showingBrokerOSDialog.png)

Please let us know if you see any issues with this new flow. If you do see a major issue and need to revert back to the old Microsoft authentication behavior, you can do so with `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` (setting it to `classic`, and restarting VS Code) but do keep in mind that this setting won't be around for much longer... so open an issue
if you are having trouble with the MSAL flow.

## Preview Features


## Proposed APIs

### Proposed Value Selection API on Quick Pick

For `InputBox` you have been able to set the "value selection" which allows you to programmatically select part or all of the input. This iteration we added proposed API to allow value selection in a QuickPick.

Here's an example of what that might look like:

```ts
const qp = vscode.window.createQuickPick();
qp.value = '12345678';
qp.valueSelection = [4, 6];
qp.items = [
	{ label: '12345678', description: 'desc 1' },
	{ label: '12345678', description: 'desc 2' },
	{ label: '12345678', description: 'desc 3' },
];
qp.show();
```

![a couple characters are selected in the quick pick's input box](images/1_96/valueSelectionQuickPick.png)

Please try out the [valueSelectionInQuickPick proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/008340a55c6391f9b333010951455ee71b338787/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.valueSelectionInQuickPick.d.ts) and let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233274)!

### Proposed Native Window Handle API

This iteration we added a new proposed API that allows you to retrieve the native window handle of the focused window. The native window handle is an OS concept that essentially provides a pointer to a particular window. This is useful if you are interacting with native code and need to, for example, render a native dialog on top of a window.

```ts
declare module 'vscode' {

	export namespace window {
		/**
		 * Retrieves the native window handle of the current active window.
		 * This will be updated when the active window changes.
		 */
		export const nativeHandle: Uint8Array | undefined;
	}
}
```

This was added specifically for Microsoft Authentication's [adoption of MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/brokering.md#window-parenting) so that we could pass the native handle down to the OS so it could render an auth dialog overtop VS Code.

If you have a use-case or feedback for the [nativeWindowHandle proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/008340a55c6391f9b333010951455ee71b338787/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.nativeWindowHandle.d.ts), let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233106)!
