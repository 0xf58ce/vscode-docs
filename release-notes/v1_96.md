## GitHub Copilot

### Copilot usage chart

You can now see a chart of an extension's copilot usage in the Runtime Status view. This chart shows the number of chat requests made by the extension over the last 30 days.

![Copilot usage chart in the Runtime Status view](images/1_96/copilot-usage-chart.png)

### Commit message generation custom instructions

This milestone we have added support for custom instructions when generating a commit message. You can use the `setting(github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions)` setting to either specify cthe ustom instructions or specify a file from your workspace that contains the custom instructions. These instructions will be appended to the prompt that is used to generate the commit message.

## Accessibility

### Code action triggered, applied sounds

Users can now hear when a code action has been triggered or applied with `setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionTriggered)` and
`setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionApplied)`.

## Workbench

### Improved extension search results

When searching for extensions using free-form text in the Extensions view, installed extensions now appear at the top of the search results. This makes it easier to find and manage your installed extensions when searching through the marketplace.

![Installed extensions shown at top of search results](images/1_96/extension-search-order.png)

### Download Extensions from the Extensions view

You can now download extensions directly from VS Code by using the download action in the context menu of an extension in the Extensions view. This can be useful if you want to download an extension without installing it.

![Download Extensions from the Extensions view](images/1_96/extensions-download.png)

### Extension Memory Usage on Disk

You can now see the memory usage of an extension on disk in the Extensions editor. This can help you understand how much disk space an extension is using.

### Extension updates optimization with vscode-unpkg service

To reduce load on the Marketplace infrastructure, VS Code now uses the newly added endpoint from the `vscode-unpkg` service to check for extension updates. The service implements server-side caching with a 10-minute TTL, significantly reducing the number of direct Marketplace requests. The optimization is controlled via `setting(extensions.gallery.useUnpkgResourceApi)` setting (enabled by default). If you are seeing any issues with extension updates, you can disable this `setting(extensions.gallery.useUnpkgResourceApi:false)` to fall back to direct Marketplace version checks.

## Editor


## Source Control

## Git blame editor decoration/status bar item (Experimental)

This milestone we have added experimental support for displaying blame information using editor decorations and a status bar item. You can enable this functionality using the `setting(git.blame.editorDecoration.enabled:true)` and `setting(git.blame.statusBarItem.enabled:true)` settings. To control the format of the message shown in the editor and in the status bar use the `setting(git.blame.editorDecoration.template)` and `setting(git.blame.statusBarItem.template)` settings. If you would like to adjust the color of the editor decoration using the `git.blame.editorDecorationForeground` theme color.

Please give this experiemtal feature a try and let us know what you think.

### Source Control Graph title actions

Based on user feedback we have brought back the `Pull`, and `Push` actions to the "Source Control Graph" view title bar. These actions will be enabled if the current history item reference is being shown in the source control graph.

## Terminal

### Terminal completions for zsh and bash (Experimental)

We added experimental support for terminal completions in `pwsh` in prior iterations.

Now, we offer completions in `zsh` and `bash` when `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled)` and
`setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enableExtensionCompletions)` are enabled.

Option and argument support is available for a small subset of commands: `cd`, `code`, and `code-insiders`.

![The command, code, is typed on the terminal, which shows suggestions. Then -- is typed and options are provided, --locale is selected. Completions are requested with ctrl+space and all locales are shown. e is typed and the list is filtered to en and es.](images/1_96/terminal-completions.gif)

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_96.md).

## Enterprise Support

### Configure Allowed Extensions

You can now control which extensions can be installed in VS Code using the `extensions.allowed` setting.  This setting allows you to specify allowed or blocked extensions by publisher, specific extensions and versions. If an extension or version is blocked, it will be disabled if already installed. You can specify the following types of extension selectors:

* Allow or block all extensions from a publisher
* Allow or block specific extensions
* Allow specific extension versions
* Allow specific extension versions and platforms
* Allow only stable versions of an extension
* Allow only stable extension versions from a publisher

The following JSON snippet shows examples of the different `extensions.allowed` setting values:

```json
"extensions.allowed": {
    // Allow all extensions from the 'microsoft' publisher. If the key does not have a '.', it means it is a publisher ID.
    "microsoft": true,

    // Allow all extensions from the 'github' publisher
    "github": true,

    // Allow prettier extension
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode": true,

    // Do not allow docker extension
    "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker": false,

    // Allow only version 3.0.0 of the eslint extension
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint": ["3.0.0"],

    // Allow multiple versions of the figma extension
    "figma.figma-vscode-extension": ["3.0.0", "4.2.3", "4.1.2"]

    // Allow version 5.0.0 of the rust extension on Windows and macOS
    "rust-lang.rust-analyzer": ["5.0.0@win32-x64", "5.0.0@darwin-x64"]

    // Allow only stable versions of the GitHub Pull Requests extension
    "github.vscode-pull-request-github": "stable",

    // Allow only stable versions from redhat publisher
    "redhat": "stable",
}
```

Specify publishers by their publisher ID. If a key does not have a period (`.`), it is considered a publisher ID. If a key has a period, it is considered an extension ID. The use of wildcards is currently not supported.

> [!TIP]
> You can use `microsoft` as the publisher ID to refer to all extensions published by Microsoft, even though they might have different publisher IDs.

Version ranges are not supported. If you want to allow multiple versions of an extension, you must specify each version individually. To further restrict versions by platform, use the `@` symbol to specify the platform. For example, `"rust-lang.rust-analyzer": ["5.0.0@win32-x64", "5.0.0@darwin-x64"]`.  For more details, refer to the [enterprise documentation](../docs/setup/enterprise.md#configure-allowed-extensions).

Administrators can also configure this setting via group policy on Windows. For more information, see the [Group Policy on Windows](../docs/setup/enterprise.md#group-policy-on-windows) section in the enterprise documentation.

## Set up VS Code with preinstalled extensions

You can set up VS Code with a set of preinstalled extensions (*bootstrap*). This functionality is useful in cases where you prepare a machine image, virtual machine, or cloud workstation where VS Code is preinstalled and specific extensions are immediately available for users.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for preinstalling extensions is currently only available on Windows.

Follow these steps to bootstrap extensions:

1. Create a folder `bootstrap\extensions` in the VS Code installation directory.

1. Download the [VSIX files](/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md#can-i-download-an-extension-directly-from-the-marketplace) for the extensions that you want to preinstall and place them in the `bootstrap\extensions` folder.

1. When a user launches VS Code for the first time, all extensions in the `bootstrap\extensions` folder are installed silently in the background.

Users can still uninstall extensions that were preinstalled. Restarting VS Code after uninstalling an extension will not reinstall the extension.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

### Microsoft Account now uses MSAL (with WAM support on Windows)

In order to ensure a strong security baseline for Microsoft authentication, we've adopted the [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) in the Microsoft Account extension.

One of the stand out features of this work is WAM (Web Account Manager... also known as [Broker](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/brokering.md)) integration. Put simply, rather than going to the browser for Microsoft authentication flows, we now talk to the OS directly which is the recommended way of acquiring a Microsoft authentication session. Additionally, it's faster since we're able to leverage the accounts that you're already logged into on the OS.

![An authentication popup that the OS shows over VS Code](images/1_96/showingBrokerOSDialog.png)

Please let us know if you see any issues with this new flow. If you do see a major issue and need to revert back to the old Microsoft authentication behavior, you can do so with `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` (setting it to `classic`, and restarting VS Code) but do keep in mind that this setting won't be around for much longer... so open an issue
if you are having trouble with the MSAL flow.

## Preview Features


## Proposed APIs

### Proposed Value Selection API on Quick Pick

For `InputBox` you have been able to set the "value selection" which allows you to programmatically select part or all of the input. This iteration we added proposed API to allow value selection in a QuickPick.

Here's an example of what that might look like:

```ts
const qp = vscode.window.createQuickPick();
qp.value = '12345678';
qp.valueSelection = [4, 6];
qp.items = [
	{ label: '12345678', description: 'desc 1' },
	{ label: '12345678', description: 'desc 2' },
	{ label: '12345678', description: 'desc 3' },
];
qp.show();
```

![a couple characters are selected in the quick pick's input box](images/1_96/valueSelectionQuickPick.png)

Please try out the [valueSelectionInQuickPick proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/008340a55c6391f9b333010951455ee71b338787/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.valueSelectionInQuickPick.d.ts) and let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233274)!

### Proposed Native Window Handle API

This iteration we added a new proposed API that allows you to retrieve the native window handle of the focused window. The native window handle is an OS concept that essentially provides a pointer to a particular window. This is useful if you are interacting with native code and need to, for example, render a native dialog on top of a window.

```ts
declare module 'vscode' {

	export namespace window {
		/**
		 * Retrieves the native window handle of the current active window.
		 * This will be updated when the active window changes.
		 */
		export const nativeHandle: Uint8Array | undefined;
	}
}
```

This was added specifically for Microsoft Authentication's [adoption of MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/brokering.md#window-parenting) so that we could pass the native handle down to the OS so it could render an auth dialog overtop VS Code.

If you have a use-case or feedback for the [nativeWindowHandle proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/008340a55c6391f9b333010951455ee71b338787/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.nativeWindowHandle.d.ts), let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233106)!
