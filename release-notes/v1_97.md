## GitHub Copilot


### Copilot Edits

#### Improved editor controls

Edits can now be accepted and discarded individually giving you more control. Also new is that the editor controls for edits remain when switching to the side-by-side view. This is useful for understanding larger changes.

_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/GitHub.github-vscode-theme/GitHub%20Light%20Colorblind%20(Beta)))_

Last, we have added a new setting that controls if edits from chat should be accepted automatically, after a configurable timeout. The setting for that `setting(chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay)`, it is the amount of seconds after which changes are accepted. The countdown stops when you interact with the accept button or when you start to review changes. Should be familiar to anyone binge-watching on the weekends.

### Apply in editor

In chat, any codeblock can be be applied to the current editor. This flow has been improved and new uses the same flow and UI as edits.

### Temporal context

Temporal context help when editing or generating code by informing the language model about files that you have recently interacted with. Our experiementation has shown that this yields much better inline chat results and therefore temporal context is now on by default for inline chat. You can configure it via `setting(github.copilot.chat.editor.temporalContext.enabled)`

For edits, we are still experimenting. If you already want to try it, the setting is `setting(github.copilot.chat.edits.temporalContext.enabled)`.

### Workspace index status UI

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Workspace search improvements

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->


## Accessibility

### Enhanced Accessibility Sounds

We've refined several accessibility sounds based on user feedback to improve clarity and distinction. The following sounds have been updated:

- `setting(accessibility.signals.save)`
- `setting(accessibility.signals.foldedAreas)`
- `setting(accessibility.signals.quickFix)`
- `setting(accessibility.signals.lineHasInlineSuggestion)`

You can preview these updates by running the command `Help: List Signal Sounds`.

### Copilot Edits Accessibility Help Dialog

Screen reader users can now access guidance on interacting with Copilot Edits by invoking:
`kb(editor.action.accessibilityHelp)` within the input box.

Additionally, when an editor contains pending Copilot edits, this status is now indicated in the editor help dialog. We've also introduced keyboard shortcuts for navigating, accepting, discarding, and toggling the diff view:
`kb(chatEditor.action.diffHunk)`

### Improved Screen Reader Notifications

When a screen reader is detected, related notifications now include a link to learn more, providing additional context and resources.

## Workbench

### Ability to move the Command Palette (and other Quick Inputs)

You can now move the Command Palette and other Quick Inputs to a new position.

<video src="images/1_97/quick-pick-move.mp4" title="Moving the Command Palette around the screen and watching it snap into different places. Then opening Customize Layout to play with the presets: top & center" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Features:
* Drag and drop the Command Palette or any other Quick Input with snapping to center and top
* Persisted position across reloads allowing you to set a new permanent position for Quick Inputs
* Preset positions available in the Customize Layout picker

### New command line option to remove a root folder from a workspace

Previously, you could add a root folder to a [multi-root workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces/multi-root-workspaces) by using the `--add` [command-line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_advanced-cli-options) option. We've now added the ability to remove a root folder from a multi-root workspace with the new `--remove` command-line option.

#### Custom title bar on Linux (Experimental)

This milestone we are starting an experiment to enable the custom title bar for a subset of Linux users:

![Linux Custom Titlebar](images/1_97/custom-title.png)

If you are not part of the experiment, you can manually configure `setting(window.titleBarStyle)` as `custom` to try it out.

You can always revert back to the native title decorations, either from the custom title context menu or by configuring `setting(window.titleBarStyle)` to `native`.

![Disable Linux Custom Titlebar](images/1_97/restore-title.png)

### Settings editor search fixes

This iteration, we fixed a regression where search queries with missing letters were not showing expected results. For example, the Settings editor was not finding the `setting(editor.formatOnPaste)` setting when a user searched for "editor formonpast".

We also fixed an issue where the Settings editor would reveal the table of contents during a search even when it was in a narrow editor group.

<video src="images/1_97/settings-editor-search.mp4" title="Searching in a narrow Settings editor for 'editor cursstyl' shows 'editor.cursorStyle' setting and does not reveal table of contents on left" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Image preview support for svgs

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Editor

### Extend find history persistence to the replace widget

Last milestone, we introduced history persistence to the editor find widget. In this milestone we are extending that further to the replace input widget so that users can maintain both separately across multiple sessions. The replace history is stored per workspace and can be disabled via the `setting(editor.find.replaceHistory)` setting.

<video src="images/1_97/replace-history.mp4" title="Demo of the persistence of editor replace history" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

## Source Control


## Terminal

### Terminal Completions for `zsh`, `bash`, and `pwsh` (Experimental)

We've introduced `terminal-suggest`, a built-in extension that provides completions for `zsh`, `bash`, and `pwsh` using our new proposed API. This replaces the previous built-in provider for `pwsh`, but providers can be customized via `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.providers)`.

This can be enabled with `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled)`.

#### Key Updates:
- Enhanced widget styling and configuration to align with the editor's suggest widget.
- A configurable status bar (`setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.showStatusBar)`) provides contextual actions and information.
- Improved argument awareness for commands, including:
  - `code`, `code-insiders`
  - `cd`, `ls`, `rm`, `echo`
  - `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`
- Displayed command or resource paths as additional details.
- Added support for directory navigation shortcuts like `.`, `..`, and `../../`.
- Enabled screen reader usage
- On Windows, configure the included executables in suggest results with `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.windowsExecutableExtensions)`
- Enhanced keyboard support to toggle details, `kb(workbench.action.terminal.suggestToggleDetails)` and toggle suggest details focus `kb(workbench.action.terminal.suggestToggleDetailsFocus)`


## Tasks

## Testing


## Languages

### TypeScript 5.7.3

This release includes the [TypeScript 5.7.3](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20%20milestone%3A%22TypeScript%205.7.3%22) recovery release. This minor update fixes a few import bugs and regressions.

### Right click to open images from the Markdown preview

You can now right click on an workspace image in the Markdown preview and select `open image` to open it in a new editor:

![Right clicking on an image in the Markdown preview to select 'Open image'](images/1_97/md-preview-open-image.png)

This is supported for any images that are part of the current workspace.

### Markdown link validation status item

VS Code's built-in Markdown features support automatically [validating local links to files and images](../docs/languages/markdown.md#link-validation). This is a great way to catch common mistakes, such linking to a header that was renamed or to a file that no longer exists on disk.

To help users discover this feature, this iteration we've added a new language status item for link validation:

![The Markdown link validation language status item](images/1_97/md-link-status-item.png)

With a Markdown file open, just click on the `{}` in the status bar to view the link validation status. You can also use the status item to quickly toggle link validation off and on.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_97.md).


## Contributions to extensions

### Microsoft Account

#### Microsoft Account now uses MSAL (with WAM support on Windows)

> NOTE: Last month's rollout of an MSAL-based authentication for Microsoft needed to be rolled back due to a critical bug. This bug has been squashed and we are proceeding with the rollout.

In order to ensure a strong security baseline for Microsoft authentication, we've adopted the [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) in the Microsoft Account extension.

One of the stand out features of this work is WAM (Web Account Manager... also known as [Broker](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/brokering.md)) integration. Put simply, rather than going to the browser for Microsoft authentication flows, we now talk to the OS directly, which is the recommended way of acquiring a Microsoft authentication session. Additionally, it's faster since we're able to leverage the accounts that you're already logged into on the OS.

![An authentication popup that the OS shows over VS Code.](images/1_97/showingBrokerOSDialog.png)

Let us know if you see any issues with this new flow. If you do see a major issue and need to revert back to the old Microsoft authentication behavior, you can do so with `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` (setting it to `classic`, and restarting VS Code) but do keep in mind that this setting won't be around for much longer. So, open an issue if you are having trouble with the MSAL flow.

### Python

#### Launch native REPL from the terminal

You will now be able to launch a VS Code Native REPL from your REPL in Terminal. Enable `setting(python.terminal.shellIntegration.enabled)` to true should display a clickable link in the Python REPL in terminal, allowing you to directly open the VS Code Native REPL from the terminal.

#### No-Config Debug

You are now able to debug a python script or module without setup right from the terminal as part of the new No-Config Debug feature! Check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-debugger/wiki/No%E2%80%90Config-Debugging) on the feature for all the details and troubleshooting tips.

<video src="images/1_97/no-config-debug.mp4" title="No-Config Debug for Python" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Test Discovery Cancelation:

When triggering test discovery from the Test Explorer UI, you can now use the cancel button, which appears in replacement of the refresh button during discovery, to cancel an ongoing test discovery call.

![Image of window during test discovery including cancelation button.](./images/1_97/test-discovery-cancelation.png)


### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues


## Preview Features

### TypeScript 5.8 beta support

This release includes support for the TypeScript 5.8 beta release. Check out the [TypeScript 5.8 blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-8-beta/) for details on what's in store for this release.

To start using preview builds of TypeScript 5.8, install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Share your feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 5.8.

## Extension Authoring

### Document paste API

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Proposed APIs

### Terminal completion provider

You can now [register a terminal completion provider](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/8d5f6f0050af2abde8c9977f1a269ef6eade6915/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.terminalCompletionProvider.d.ts#L79-L87) and let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/226562).

An example of this can be found in our terminal suggest extension, which provides completions when enabled via `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled)`.

### Terminal shell type

Extensions will be able to [access currently active shell type information](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/8d5f6f0050af2abde8c9977f1a269ef6eade6915/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.terminalShellType.d.ts).
The shellType field will be part of TerminalState.

Use this shell type information to perform shell specific operations that you need.

## Engineering

### Less resource consumption from file watching in large TypeScript workspaces

A couple of optimisations have been made to reduce the overhead file watching has in large TypeScript workspaces (thousands of TypeScript files or projects). Specifically when opening such a workspace and initialising the watcher, spikes in CPU usage should either not be seen anymore or settle quickly.

See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/237351 for more details.


## Notable fixes

* [230438](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/230438) Support for code page `1125` aka `cp866u`
* [238577](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/238577) Increase default window size

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
