## GitHub Copilot

### Copilot Edits

#### Improved editor controls

Edits can now be accepted and discarded individually giving you more control. Also new is that the editor controls for edits remain when switching to the side-by-side view. This is useful for understanding larger changes.

_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/GitHub.github-vscode-theme/GitHub%20Light%20Colorblind%20(Beta)))_

Last, we have added a new setting that controls if edits from chat should be accepted automatically, after a configurable timeout. The setting for that `setting(chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay)`, it is the amount of seconds after which changes are accepted. The countdown stops when you interact with the accept button or when you start to review changes. Should be familiar to anyone binge-watching on the weekends.

### Apply in editor

In chat, any codeblock can be be applied to the current editor. This flow has been improved and new uses the same flow and UI as edits.

### Temporal context

Temporal context help when editing or generating code by informing the language model about files that you have recently interacted with. Our experiementation has shown that this yields much better inline chat results and therefore temporal context is now on by default for inline chat. You can configure it via `setting(github.copilot.chat.editor.temporalContext.enabled)`

For edits, we are still experimenting. If you already want to try it, the setting is `setting(github.copilot.chat.edits.temporalContext.enabled)`.

## Accessibility


## Workbench

### New command line option to remove a root folder from a workspace

A new command line option `--remove` allows to remove root folders from a workspace. This option complements the already existing `--add` option to add a root folder to a workspace.

#### Custom title bar on Linux (Experimental)

This milestone we are starting an experiment to enable the custom title bar for a subset of Linux users:

![Linux Custom Titlebar](images/1_97/custom-title.png)

If you are not part of the experiment, you can manually configure `setting(window.titleBarStyle)` as `custom` to try it out.

You can always revert back to the native title decorations, either from the custom title context menu or by configuring `setting(window.titleBarStyle)` to `native`.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

### Less resource consumption from file watching in large TypeScript workspaces

A couple of optimisations have been made to reduce the overhead file watching has in large TypeScript workspaces (thousands of TypeScript files or projects). Specifically when opening such a workspace and initialising the watcher, spikes in CPU usage should either not be seen anymore or settle quickly.

See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/237351 for more details.


## Notable fixes

* [230438](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/230438) Support for code page `1125` aka `cp866u`
* [238577](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/238577) Increase default window size

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
