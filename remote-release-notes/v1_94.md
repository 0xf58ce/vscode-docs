## Core

## Dev Containers

### Attach to a Kubernetes container over SSH/Tunnel

Dev Containers now supports attaching to a Kubernetes container when connected via Remote-SSH or Remote-Tunnels. Simply select **Dev Containers: Attach to Running Kubernetes Container...** from the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) and pick the container to attach to.

### User setting for GPU availability

When the automatic GPU detection doesn't work as expected, you can now use the new user setting, <a href="vscode://settings/dev.containers.gpuAvailability" codesetting="true">`dev.containers.gpuAvailability`</a>, to specify whether or not GPUs are available.

This makes sure that you will get the expected behavior when a `devcontainer.json` configures GPU as an optional resource (`"hostRequirements": { "gpu": "optional" }`).
